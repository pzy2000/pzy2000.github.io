**Zhiyuan Peng (ÂΩ≠ÂøóËøú/Lucius Peng)** is the first-year Ph.D. student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Dr. Xin Yin, Prof. Chenhao Ying and Prof. Yuan Luo.

My research interest includes **Large Language Model, Software Testing, and Software Security**. I have published papers at the top international conferences such as **ASE** and **EMNLP**. I developed a few well-known approaches including:
- [SolEval](https://github.com/pzy2000/SolEval) and [PrefGen](https://github.com/pzy2000/PrefGen): Smart Contract Generation

In 2025, I will lead or participate in the following research topics:
- Software Testing: Unit Test Generation
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Agent
