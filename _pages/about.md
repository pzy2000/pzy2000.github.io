**Zhiyuan Peng (彭志远/Lucius Peng)** is the second-year Ph.D. student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Dr. Xin Yin](https://vinci-grape.github.io/), [Prof. Chenhao Ying](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=464) and [Prof. Yuan Luo](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=87). I was grateful to intern at Tencent LIGHTSPEED Studios and MSRA.

My research interest includes *Code Generation, Large Language Model, and Software Testing*. I have published serveral papers at the top international conferences such as **ASE** and **EMNLP**. I developed a few well-known approaches including:
- [SolEval](https://github.com/pzy2000/SolEval) and [PrefGen](https://github.com/pzy2000/PrefGen): Solidity Code Generation

In 2025, I will lead or participate in the following research topics:
- Code Generation: Agentic Code Gen, Smart Contract
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Agent, GUI-Testing
